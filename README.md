This ambitious project seeks to transform the travel industry by introducing an innovative recommendation system that tailors travel destinations to individual preferences. The overarching goal is
to revolutionize the travel experience, augment customer satisfaction, and enhance decision-making
within the tourism sector. The project employs advanced machine learning models, specifically
collaborative filtering (CF) approaches such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an off-the-hood Geo-Social Location
Recommender, and a Two-Tower Neural Recommender.
